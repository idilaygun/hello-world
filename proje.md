### Modeling a DC-motor drive system
**Prepared by İdil Aygün**

# 1. Introduction

# 2. Design of Three Models

* Table of Parameters*

**a)** Construction a Model with Simple Simulink Blocks:
In this modelling, DC motor is represented with blocks. That block are designed based on two following equations
*Armature voltage...*
*Electrical Torque...*

**b)** Construction of a Model by using Simscape without DC Motor Block:

**c)** Construction of a Model by the Aid of DC Motor Block

3.Analysis of Models
After checking consistency of the models, they are analyzed according to the below  sections:

**a)**Applying Rated Value to Armature Voltage:
*Graphs and explanations...*
**b)** Applying Half of the Rated Value to Armature Voltage:

*Graphs and explanations...*
**c)** Desing Voltage Controller:
